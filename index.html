        <h3 id="founder">Frank Occidentale</h3>
        <p id="bio">
            Frank has worked in a variety of manufacturing industries, including orthopedic manufacturer Stryker Corporation and cardiovascular manufacturer Boston Scientific. Wanting to utilize his varied experience and believing the need to merge prototype manufacturing with early research and development designs,  Frank started the Medilogic Group. This allowed what has traditionally been a two stage process into the development of a single seamless, integrated process. This has resulted in Frank being able to provide excellent and specialized design, engineering and manufacturing services to the medical device community. As owner, Frank continues to grow and expand the Medilogic Group by successfully serving a multitude of clients.
